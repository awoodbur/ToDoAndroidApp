# To_Do_List
A portfolio task managing Android app built using Jetpack Compose

This To-Do List app was built using the latest versions of Jetpack Compose and Kotlin.
The app uses a single activity, no fragments, and an MVVM architecture.
I used ROOM database for data storage, "Preference DataStore" to persist priority information,
and "Dagger-Hilt" for dependency injections.
